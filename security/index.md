## üìë Available Security Instruction Files

### Core Security Concepts

- [Security Principles](/security/security-principles.md) - Core security principles and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
  - Keywords: `#security #principles #owasp #top10 #vulnerabilities`
  - When to use: For foundational security knowledge and understanding the most critical security risks.

- [Security General Practices](/security/security-general-practices.md) - General security practices applicable to most applications.
  - Keywords: `#security #general #practices #input-validation #secrets-management #compliance #privacy`
  - When to use: For implementation of common security practices like input validation, output encoding, and compliance considerations.

### Implementation-Focused Guides

- [Security Implementation Examples](/security/security-implementation-examples.md) - Practical code examples for implementing security features.
  - Keywords: `#security #implementation #code #examples #practical`
  - When to use: When you need ready-to-use code patterns for common security implementations like password hashing, JWT handling, or SQL injection prevention.

- [Security API Design](/security/security-api-design.md) - Patterns and code examples for secure API design.
  - Keywords: `#security #api #design #patterns #auth #jwt #oauth`
  - When to use: When building APIs and needing patterns for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and secure API responses.

- [Security Rules](/security/security-rules.md) - Structured rule directives for GitHub Copilot to follow.
  - Keywords: `#security #rules #directives #guidelines #standards`
  - When to use: When you need specific, structured guidance for GitHub Copilot when implementing security features.

## üéØ How to Choose the Right Files

1. **For general security guidance:**
   - Start with [Security Principles](/security/security-principles.md)
   - Then add [Security General Practices](/security/security-general-practices.md)

2. **When implementing specific security features:**
   - Load [Security Implementation Examples](/security/security-implementation-examples.md)
   - Reference the specific section within the file that corresponds to your task

3. **When building APIs:**
   - Include [Security API Design](/security/security-api-design.md)
   - For complete API security, also include [Security Principles](/security/security-principles.md) for OWASP awareness

4. **For web application security:**
   - Start with [Security Principles](/security/security-principles.md) (OWASP Top 10)
   - Add [Security Implementation Examples](/security/security-implementation-examples.md) (XSS Prevention and File Upload sections)

5. **For database access security:**
   - Load [Security Implementation Examples](/security/security-implementation-examples.md) (SQL Injection Prevention section)
   - Add [Security General Practices](/security/security-general-practices.md) (for general input validation)

6. **For specific GitHub Copilot guidance on security:**
   - Load [Security Rules](/security/security-rules.md) for structured directives
   - Combine with specific implementation examples as needed

## Using Security Rules

The **Security Rules** file contains structured directives that GitHub Copilot can follow. These rules use the format:

```markdown
@security Rule - RuleName: RuleDescription
```

Example usage in your Copilot instructions:

```markdown
<instructions>
@security Rule - Validate All Input: Always validate and sanitize all input from external sources.
@security Rule - SQL Injection Prevention: Always use parameterized queries or ORMs instead of string concatenation.
</instructions>
```

You can combine security rules with other topic rules for cross-domain projects:

```markdown
<instructions>
@security Rule - Validate All Input: Always validate and sanitize all input from external sources.
@fastapi Rule - Response Models: Define explicit response models using Pydantic.
</instructions>
```
