# GitHub Copilot Instructions Collection

![GitHub Copilot](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/site/copilot/copilot.png)

A structured collection of instruction files that help enhance your GitHub Copilot experience with domain-specific guidance and best practices.

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains modular instruction files for GitHub Copilot that provide targeted guidance for different technologies and domains. Each instruction file is designed to be:

- **Focused** - Addresses specific aspects of development
- **Modular** - Can be used independently or combined with other files
- **Token-efficient** - Split into manageable sizes to optimize token usage
- **Rule-oriented** - Includes structured directives that help Copilot follow specific guidelines

## 🚀 How to Use This Collection

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Github-Copilot-Instructions.git
   ```

2. Select instruction files based on your current task:
   - For Python development: Use files in the `/python/` directory
   - For FastAPI development: Use files in the `/fastapi/` directory
   - For security concerns: Use files in the `/security/` directory

3. Include the selected instructions in your GitHub Copilot chat or editor.

### Using Structured Rule Directives

This collection includes structured rule directives in the format:

```markdown
@topicName Rule - RuleName: RuleDescription
```

These directives help GitHub Copilot understand specific guidelines for different technologies. You can:

1. **Include entire rule files** for comprehensive guidance on a topic
2. **Copy specific rules** when you need targeted guidance
3. **Combine rules from different topics** for cross-domain projects

Example rule usage in your Copilot instructions:

```markdown
<instructions>
@python Rule - Follow PEP 8: When writing Python code, always follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
@security Rule - Validate All Input: Always validate and sanitize all input from external sources.
@fastapi Rule - Response Models: Define explicit response models using Pydantic.
</instructions>
```

### Task-Based File Selection Examples

| Task | Recommended Instruction Files |
|------|------------------------------|
| Building a new Python script | Python Core Principles, Python Code Quality |
| Creating a FastAPI application | FastAPI Foundations, FastAPI Documentation, Security Principles |
| Implementing user authentication | Security Implementation Examples, Security API Design |
| Optimizing Python code | Python Performance |
| Setting up API endpoints | FastAPI API & DB Standards, Security API Design |
| Deploying a FastAPI app | FastAPI Deployment |
| Securing database operations | Security Implementation Examples, FastAPI API & DB Standards |
| Adding GraphQL to FastAPI | FastAPI GraphQL |
| Error handling in FastAPI | FastAPI Error Handling |
